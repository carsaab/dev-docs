## CORS

The file is downloaded by the user's browser, so you will need to add correct [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS) when replying to the request:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

Or:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: $ORIGIN
```

Where `$ORIGIN` is the `Origin` header of the request, i.e. `flat.io` or `[domain].flat.io` for private websites).
